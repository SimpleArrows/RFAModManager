![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/3rNPPr2.png "First release picture")

This tool helps you install, create and share mods easily. 3 mods have already been provided in the download to show you how the new mod manager system works compared to the tool for Red Faction: Guerrila (Re-Mars-tered).

The mod manager similarly creates a backup of the VPPs it edits and renames table.vpp_pc for you to prevent any problems from occuring!

### Downloading & Installing Mods

To download user-made mod manager compatible mods, you can visit this site here:
