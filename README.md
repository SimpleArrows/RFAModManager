### Info

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/3rNPPr2.png "First release picture")

This tool helps you install, create and share mods easily. 3 mods have already been provided in the download to show you how the new mod manager system works compared to the tool for Red Faction: Guerrila (Re-Mars-tered).

The mod manager similarly creates a backup of the VPPs it edits and renames table.vpp_pc for you to prevent any problems from occuring!



### Creating Mods

Creating mods is now more simpler in this mod manager, the steps go as follows. Knowing how to mod and edit files with the Red Faction: Guerrilla Mod Manager is recommended, as I won't be going into how to do this.

* Download the Saints Row 3 modding tools by Gibbed: (https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524727117339164692/591856625401200650/gibbedvolition-rev96.zip), place the folder wherever you like.

* Navigate to your game directory (Red Faction: Armageddon) and go to the build folder, pc, then cache. Find the misc.vpp_pc file and drag it into the Gibbed.SaintsRow3.UnpackVPP exe file from the folder you just downloaded & extracted.

* Navigate back to the cache folder where the misc.vpp_pc file has been unpacked, it should be named "misc".

* Look for a file that you would like to edit. Open it up in a file editing program (Notepad++, Sublime Text, etc.)

* Go to your "mods" folder located in the game directory, you can open the mod manager and click on New Mod then fill in all the textboxes. On the right side of the window browse for the file that you edited in the "misc" folder in build/pc/cache.

* Once you are done, click the Create button.

* Now you can share the mod and upload it! Navigate to the "mods" folder and click on your mod folder and make it a ZIP file (if you have 7ZIP you can do 7-Zip > Add to (foldername).zip).

### Downloading & Installing Mods

After downloading a mod, you can extract it into the "mods" folder located in your game directory. After doing so, you can then open the mod manager, select the mod on the left side of the program and click on the Activate button at the top.
